# Cuda Corner
This is just a place for me to explore the expanding space of parallel computing on GPUs. It will contain some scripts I created while learning and also some small projects which are found below

## Projects
### - Fluid Sim
  Basic fluid simulation which calculates density and then calculates the pressure force acting on "water" particles. I started with first testing principles in Python, then in C and finally it was converted to a C + Cuda project.
  I plan to add gravity and maybe the ability to add an object to see the interaction.

### - Matrix Operations
  Here I tried to implement basic matrix operations which will be used in the future when I plan to convert some Machine learning to Cuda which is extremely dependent on Matrix operations
